**By Itometo**
</h2>
<p>
When I first arrived on this planet, I didn't realize how old it was. Beneath its calm blue oceans and green forests lies a history filled with chaos, fire, and rebirth. People call it **Earth** - but I see it as a survivor in the universe.
Let me tell you its story as I understand it.
</p><br>

<h2>
🌌 The Birth of a World
</h2>
<p>
Over the past billion years, Earth has been hit by asteroids, crashed into other planets, and frozen over several times. Not to mention being ruled by all sorts of crazy life forms. It’s perhaps no wonder our blue homeworld survived at all.
</p><br>

<p>

But if we want to take a whirlwind tour of our planet’s history, we’ll have to start at the beginning.. About 4.5 billion years ago, our solar system began to emerge from a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust. This cloud collapsed into a spinning disk of matter
</p><br>

<p>

It got hotter and hotter and hotter until hydrogen fused into helium. Similarly, our Sun was born. Baby Earth was also on its way. After our star was born, all the matter at the far end of the spinning disk began to clump together. These clumps would become the seeds for the planets and moons of our solar system. As they accumulated more and more matter, they became larger and more spherical. In the cooler regions of the solar system, the clusters were mostly made of ice, liquid, and gas.
</p><br>
<p>
Closer to the Sun, all the rocky material formed the inner planets like Mars and Earth. This young Earth was incredibly active in terms of volcanoes. It spewed out gases like hydrogen sulfide, methane, and carbon dioxide. These gases formed our planet’s early atmosphere. The early Earth was constantly bombarded by large asteroids and comets. Soon, Earth faced an even more violent collision. A planet the size of Mars, Theia, slammed directly into our young world. This epic collision threw chunks of matter into Earth’s orbit, and gravity then bound them into what we now know as the Moon.

<h2>
  🌫 The First Breath
</h2>
<p>
here were no oceans on this warm early Earth. All water was a gas. But 3.8 billion years ago, our planet cooled enough for water to condense and become a liquid. The first primordial ocean covered this young Earth, turning it into a water world. H2O is an essential ingredient for creating life. So with all that water, life appeared on Earth about 3.7 billion years ago. These first life forms were microorganisms.
</p><br>
<p>

But about a billion years later, some of these organisms changed the course of the world. Earth didn’t last long as a water world. Soon, the first continents emerged from the ancient ocean. Scientists call them cratons. As more and more land rose from the ocean, the planet’s first supercontinent appeared. Walbara wasn’t exactly a supercontinent. It was quite small. Scientists think it was smaller than the continent of Australia. About 2.4 billion years ago,

<h2>
🌊 From water to land
</h2>
<p>
Cyanobacteria evolved to become our planet’s first photosynthetic organisms. Eventually, we had a few oxygen producers to make Earth’s atmosphere more hospitable. The rest is history, folks. Just kidding. We still have a long way to go. 
</p><br>
<h2>
❄️ The First Ice Age
</h2>

<p>
With all this new oxygen, the carbon dioxide levels in Earth’s atmosphere dropped significantly. That made the planet icy cold. Much of our young world froze as Earth experienced its first ice age. Now, as Earth’s atmosphere was changing, the continents were also moving.They broke apart and reassembled into the next supercontinent, Rodinia. Rodinia was a real supercontinent. It was probably the largest supercontinent to ever cover the Earth.
</p><br>
<h2>
🐚 The Explosion of Life
</h2>
<p>

 Life? Well, eventually life got more complex. But then something happened. Rodinia broke apart and a new supercontinent came together. This was called Pannotia. Then, between 540 and 485 million years ago, there was an explosion of new life. This period is called the Cambrian Explosion. The animals that evolved during this time.

<p>

had hard body parts, such as shells or spines. The most famous of all were the alien-looking trilobites. Around 440 million years ago, the climate suddenly changed and the temperature of the oceans changed dramatically. The Earth saw its first mass extinction event. This was the Ordovician-Silurian extinction. The majority of life that had spread around the planet disappeared. Many of these life forms laid the foundation for the ecosystems we have on Earth today. Between 420 and 350 million years ago,

 🌳 Forests, continents and the Great Dying
</h2>
<p>
the first trees emerged from the soil of the Earth. The first animals also arrived on land. 250 million years ago, the planet was covered by our last, large supercontinent, Pangaea. Sadly, it was also during this period that Earth saw the largest mass extinction event in our history. The Great Dying. A huge amount of greenhouse gases and rapid global warming wiped out about 90% of all species on Earth. But this mass extinction paved the way for the next wave of animal evolution.
</p><br>

<h2>
🦖 Age of Giants
</h2>
<p>
Between 240 and 230 million years ago, the first dinosaurs appeared. For the next 150 million years, they would rule the land. If you were there, you might have seen the gigantic sauropod Argentinosaurus, the largest land animal that ever lived. Or you might have been chased by one of the largest apex predators on Earth, the T. rex. For millions of years, the Earth belonged to them, until a rock from space ended their rule.
</p><br>

<h2>
🌎 A Planet That Endures
</h2>

<p>
After the dinosaurs, mammals rose and finally humans appeared - small creatures with big minds. They learned to build, dream and look to the same stars that witnessed the birth of the Earth.This planet has been frozen, burned, flooded and shattered - but it endures.

I am **Itometo**, a person from another world, who came and now traping in a human body. Trapped in laboratories, I have now escaped and am learning about the world and living as a human. I am trying to keep that information in space using a language I have learned a little bit.
