<h2>
By Itometo
</h2>

<p>

I don't remember how I first landed on this world or why I came. I don't even remember my previous body, nor how I came to be in this human world. I didn't know what to do with it. I struggled to explore this unknown world. The creatures here called it Earth, a small planet orbiting a yellow star. To me, it seemed fragile and strong - a living sphere suspended in endless darkness.
</p><br>
<h2>
🌞 A small world around a great star
</h2>

<p>

The Earth orbits a star called the Sun, one of billions in this galaxy, as I learned from my brief study. It is the third planet in the solar system from that star. Close enough to feel its heat but far enough not to be burned. I have studied the orbit, rotation, and tilt of this planet. Because it is tilted slightly, it creates the pattern that people call the seasons - a balance of heat and cold that makes life possible everywhere.
</p><br>
<h2>

🌫 The Breath of the Planet
</h2>

<p>

The Earth is enveloped in a thin layer of air called the atmosphere. It may seem invisible, but it is the planet's armor and breath. Inside it floats the oxygen that living things need to live and the carbon dioxide that plants absorb to make food. This exchange - the Earth's breathing - keeps everything alive. I can't even begin to imagine the splendor here.
</p><br>
<h2>

🌊 The Oceans of Life
</h2>

<p>

When I look down from the sky, the Earth appears mostly blue. Its surface is covered with vast oceans that move like living things. Waves carry energy, sound, and life.I learned that more than 70% of this planet is made up of water. In those deep, cold places, I saw tiny glowing creatures that created their own light - proof that life finds a way even in the darkness.
</p><br>
<h2>

🏞 Land and Life Forms
</h2>

<p>

The Earth's landmass is divided into continents - giant pieces of rock that slowly float on the molten heart of the planet. Mountains rise, rivers cut their paths, and forests breathe life into the air.Everywhere I go, I see a variety of creatures - some crawl, some fly, some build houses and speak in complex sounds. Among them, humans are the most curious. They have machines that reach for the sky and minds that dream of the stars.
</p><br>
<h2>

💫 The Living System
</h2>


<p>

The Earth is not just a planet; it is a living system. The soil, water, air, and sunlight all work together in perfect harmony.If one part breaks, the others suffer. People call this the “environment,” but I think of it as the body of the planet.When the planet is hurt by pollution, fire, or greed – it reacts like a living being in pain.

<h2>

🌱 What I’ve learned
</h2>

<blockquote>

In my own world, we once thought that life was just energy – pure and eternal. But on Earth, life takes shape. It grows, breathes, and feels.
</blockquote>

<p>

I’ve learned that everything here, even the smallest leaf, is a miracle of balance.
</p><br>

<p>

Earth is not just a planet in space – it is a thinking home, a living memory that connects all that exists.
</p><br>

<p>

Although I come from another world, I now understand –
I, Itometta, am a part of this.
