      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        We are itometo (https://itometo.com
). Your privacy matters. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you visit our website.
      </p><br>
      <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
      <p>
        At present, itometo.com does not collect personal data directly from users, such as names, email addresses, or payment details.
However, like many websites, we may collect limited information automatically through third-party services and tools, including:
      </p><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Analytics and monitoring tools to understand traffic and performance</li>
        <li>Advertising services to deliver ads</li>
      </ul><br>

      <h2>2. Use of Information</h2><br>

      <p>
        Any limited data collected by third-party tools or services may be used for:
      </p><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Tracking and analyzing traffic on the website</li>
        <li>Improving user experience and site performance</li>
        <li>Displaying personalized or non-personalized ads</li>
      </ul><br>


      <h2>3. Cookies & Tracking Technologies</h2><br>
      <p>
        Although you requested not to use cookies, third-party ad or analytics services might still employ cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to collect information.
You may choose to disable cookies via your browser settings, though certain features or advertisements might not function properly or display accurately if cookies are disabled.
      </p><br>


      <h2>4. Third-Party Services & Links</h2><br>
      <p>Our website may use or link to the following types of third-party services:</p><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Advertising networks (e.g. Google AdSense or similar)</li>
        <li>Analytics or webmaster tools</li>
        <li>External websites via links</li>
      </ul><br>
      <p>These third parties may collect data according to their own practices. We do not control their policies. Please refer to their individual privacy policies for more details.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>5. Your Privacy Rights</h2><br>
      <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights related to personal data, such as:</p><br>
      <ul>
        <li>GDPR (EU/EEA): the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict use of your personal data</li>
        <li>CCPA (California, USA): the right to know what data is collected, request deletion, and opt out of the sale of personal data</li>
      </ul><br>
      <p>Because we do not actively collect personal data, these rights mostly relate to data held or processed by third parties (e.g., advertising or analytics providers).</p>
      <br>
      <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2><br>
      <p>Our website is not intended for children under 13 (or under 16 in certain jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>7. Data Security</h2><br>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect any data handled via the website (or by third parties) from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
      </p><br>

      <h2>8. Policy Updates</h2><br>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with a revised “Effective Date.” Your continued use of itometo.com after those changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>
      <br>
